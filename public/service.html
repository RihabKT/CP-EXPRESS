 <h3> Fingerprints and Other Biometrics: </h3>
 <div class="flexy">
    <p>The FBI provides a variety of services, information, and training involving biometrics— <br/>the measurable biological (anatomical and physiological) or behavioral characteristics <br/> used for identification of an individual. Fingerprints are a common biometric modality, but others <br/> include things like DNA, irises, voice patterns, palmprints, and facial patterns. In an effort to harness <br/> new technologies and improve identifications, the Bureau developed its Next Generation <br/> Identification (NGI) system, which provides the criminal justice community with the world's largest <br/> and most efficient electronic repository of biometric and criminal history information.   </p>

 <h3> National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS): </h3>
<h5> NICS Process :</h5>
<div class="flexy">
 <p> When a person tries to buy a firearm, the seller, known as a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL),<br/> contacts NICS electronically or by phone. The prospective buyer fills out the ATF form, and the FFL <br/> relays that information to the NICS. The NICS staff performs a background check on the buyer.<br/> That background check verifies the buyer does not have a criminal record or isn't otherwise ineligible <br/> to purchase or own a firearm. Since launching in 1998, more than 300 million checks <br/> have been done, leading to more than 1.5 million denials.</p>
